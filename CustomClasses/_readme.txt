Custom Classes Use

In Lesson 5 we discuss using a class path to locate all of the custom classes made during these lessons.

To use this folder for your Classes, set up a class path in your Flash Acrionscript preferences:

	go to "Edit >> Preferences" on the PC or
	go to "Flash 8 Professional >> Preferences" on the Mac
	select the ActionScript category and select "ActionScript 2.0 Settings..." 	
	click the "+" button to add a new class path
	select the browse button at the top (looks like a target)
	browse to your desktop (or wherever you placed your Total Training project files)
	select the Custom Classes Folder
	click "ok" to select the folder and "ok" to close the preferences

Now you can place any Class.as file in this folder and your Flash application will find it.

This folder also includes a zip file which contains all of the classes created named "finished classes.zip".
To use these finished classes instead of writing your own - simply unzip the classes into the folder.

You can find more information by following Lesson 5.

If you wish to use the slider component but have not completed Lesson 6 of Part 1, the component file is included in the zip file as well as the Slider Class file.

	Extract the zip and find the "Slider.as" and "Slider.fla" files.
	You can place the "Slider.as" file in the Custom Classes folder 
	and follow the instructions above to set up the Custom Classes folder 
	to be included in your Flash Applications Class Paths.

	Then copy the "Slider.fla" file to one of the following locations,
	depending on your operating system:

	For Windows XP:

	C:\Documents and Settings\[your user name]\Local Settings\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash 8\en\Configuration\Components.
			

	For Mac OS 10:
	[hard drive]\Users\[your user name]\Library\Applications support\Macromedia\Flash 8\en\configuration\components

	If you are using an older operating system or are having trouble locating the directory - please refer to the flash help on class and component class paths, which is also refered to as the global class path.
